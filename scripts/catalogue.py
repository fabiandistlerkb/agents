"""The skill catalogue, as the consistency checks read it.

The catalogue lives in `skills.json`, which `scripts/build_manifest.py`
generates from each SKILL.md's frontmatter. This module hands out one entry per
skill, so a checker asks it what skills exist and what the catalogue says about
them instead of crawling `skills/` with its own frontmatter regexes.

The manifest source is a parameter, defaulting to the repo-root `skills.json`,
so a checker can also be driven from a fixture catalogue. The manifest must be
current for the answers to mean anything — CI runs `build_manifest.py --check`
as its first gate for that reason — and a missing manifest raises rather than
reporting an empty catalogue.

`build_manifest.py` stays the sole writer and the sole parser of SKILL.md; the
dependency runs one way only. Stdlib-only.
