"""Enforce the skill-description budget.

Run from repo root:
    python3 scripts/check_descriptions.py    # exit 1 on any over-budget skill

Codex CLI budgets only ~2% of the context window for skill descriptions, so an
oversized frontmatter `description` gets the list truncated — the metadata that
drives triggering is exactly what gets cut. This check keeps each SKILL.md
`description` within a hard budget and the aggregate over auto-triggered skills
under the Codex cap. Trigger lists and feature enumerations belong in the
SKILL.md body (progressive disclosure), not the always-loaded frontmatter.

This is a stricter *policy* layer on top of build_manifest.py's 1024-char
spec cap; the two are deliberately decoupled. Stdlib-only; reuses the
frontmatter parser from build_manifest.py.
