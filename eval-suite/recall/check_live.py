"""Live trigger check: does a router actually fire inside the agent?

Run from repo root:
    python3 eval-suite/recall/check_live.py --category architecture
    python3 eval-suite/recall/check_live.py --category architecture --flat
    python3 eval-suite/recall/check_live.py --category architecture --reps 3 --model claude-opus-5

`check_recall.py` shows the model a *menu* of descriptions and forces it to pick
one. That measures which skill wins once the model has decided to consult a
skill at all; it cannot see the more common failure, where the model answers an
architecture question from its own knowledge and never opens the router. This
check measures that: it starts a real `claude -p` session with the repo's
plugins loaded, sends one realistic prompt, and records from the event stream
whether the router skill was invoked and which member `SKILL.md` was read.

Each prompt in `live_prompts.json` names the `category` it belongs to and an
`expected` member name, `any` (the router should fire, the member is a
judgement call) or `none` (a near-miss that must not fire). Prompts are run
`--reps` times each because triggering is stochastic; report rates, not single
runs.

Three surfaces can reach a member: the router hands off to it, the model reads
its `SKILL.md` directly, or a plugin subagent that works from that member is
launched and the router never opens at all. Each run records which surface got
there first and the report prints the tally, so a category's numbers say where
the triggering actually happens.

`--flat` swaps the category's router for a throwaway plugin that registers
every member individually — the pre-router layout — so the two can be
compared on the same prompts and model.

Needs the `claude` CLI on PATH; prints SKIP and exits 0 without it. Every run
costs real tokens (roughly 30-60 s and a few cents each). Stdlib-only.
